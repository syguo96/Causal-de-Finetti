# Causal de Finetti: On the Identification of Invariant Causal Structure in Exchangeable Data
This code implements the experiments conducted in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15756). 

`binar-bivariate-causal-discovery.ipynb` - this detects bivariate causal direction in multi-environment exchangeable data. This recovers Figure 3 in the paper. 

`multivariate-causal-discovery.ipynb` - this recovers multivariate causal structure in multi-environment exchangeable data. This recovers Figure 4 in the paper.
